# Battleship
It's a very popular game - Battleship made in .Net and Console UI. 
To start it, simply clone repository, execute commands 
```dotnet build``` 
and then 
```dotnet run```. Console application will apear and you'll be asked to place your two battleships (5 squares size) and one destroyer (4 squares size). 
Afterwards, computer will place its ships (on its own board) and you will be asked to fire at computer's ships. Computer will answer with fire!

On your board, you can see your ships (marked with **B** (battleship) or **D** (destroyer)). Sign **O** means this position has not been fire at yet. **X** is a hit, **M** is a miss.

You and computer fire to each other until one of the player has no ships on the board. 

Enjoy! :)
